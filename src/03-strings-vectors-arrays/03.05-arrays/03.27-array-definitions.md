```cpp
int txt_size();

unsigned buf_size = 1024;

int ia[buf_size];
int ib[4 * 7 - 14];
int ic[txt_size()];
char st[11] = "fundamental";
```
`ia` is invalid, because `buf_size` is not const.
`ib` is valid.
`ic` is not valid because txt_size is not constexpr.
`st` is not valid, because the initializer is too long so the terminating 0 character won't fit.
