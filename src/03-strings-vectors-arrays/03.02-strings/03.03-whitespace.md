**Q**: How are whitespace characters handled by `operator>>` and `getline`?

**A**:
* `operator>>` reads tokens from an `istream`. Any whitespace separates tokens. `operator>>' ignores empty tokens (e.g. empty lines) and repeats trying to read the next token until it encounters a non-empty token or EOF.
* `getline` reads tokens from an `istream`. Only newlines separate tokens, other whitespace is regarded as part of the token. `getline` accepts empty tokens.
