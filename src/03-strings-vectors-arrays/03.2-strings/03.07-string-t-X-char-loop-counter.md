If one used a for loop with a `char` loop counter variable the counter would wrap around from 127 to -128. After wrapping around -128 would be promoted to the unsigned type `std::string::size_type` as part of the comparison. This would result in `size_type`'s max value minus 127 and terminate the loop after 128 iterations, except for strings of length (`size_type`'s max value - 126) or longer. For those it would only handle 128 characters at the beginning and the characters from position (`size_type`'s max - 127) to the end.

If one used a signed char the loop would become an endless loop for strings with more than 256 characters because the counter would wrap around from 255 to 0 and never fulfill the condition.
