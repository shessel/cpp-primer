`vector<vector<int>> ivec;` is legal on c++11 compliant compilers. Otherwise there needs to be a space between the two closing angle brackets.

`vector<string> svec = ivec;` is illegal because you can't copy initialize a vector<string> from a vector<vector<int>>.

`vector<string> svec(10, "null");` is legal, svec will contain 10 `string` objects with value `"null"`.
